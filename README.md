## Requirements

Web Application Updates
For this assignment, we will update our web application to verify the user's email address on sign-up. The email verification flow should be as follows:

The user creates a new account.
The web application creates a one-time use token (stored in the DynamoDB, schema/model not included in swagger) and posts a message to the SNS topic. The message includes the following at minimum:
User's email address.
One-time use token.
Message Type
The one-time-use token should be valid for only 5 minutes after creation. Use the DynamoDB TTL feature Links to an external site.to implement this. 
SNS will trigger the Lambda function which will send an email to the user. The email message must include a valid link to your domain (which is environment-specific i.e. in dev, the link should be for the dev subdomain). Example link: http://prod.domain.tld/v1/verifyUserEmail?email=user@example.com&token=sometoken Links to an external site. 
The email message should have proper DKIM signature and SPF records.
The email message should not end up in the user's SPAM/Junk folder.
When the user clicks on the link (while it is valid), the user should be marked as verified.
Unverified users should not be able to make any authenticated API call until they have verified their account.
We will not implement an API for users to request a new one-time-use token to verify the user account. 


Secure Application Endpoints
Warning: Do not store your SSL certificates in the GitHub repository.

Secure your web application endpoints with valid SSL certificates.
For dev environment, you may use the AWS Certificate Manager Links to an external site. service to get SSL certificates.
For prod environment, you must request an SSL certificate from Namecheap Links to an external site.or any other SSL vendor except for AWS Certificate Manager, import it into AWS Certificate Manager Links to an external site. from your CLI, and then configure your load balancer to use the imported certificate.
The command to import the certificate must be documented in your README.md file.
Plain text requests sent to HTTP do not have to be supported.
HTTP to HTTPS redirection is not required.
Traffic from the load balancer to the EC2 instance can use plain text protocol such as HTTP.
Users should not be able to connect to the EC2 instance directly.
